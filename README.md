# Welcome to CourseRoad, a four-year acamdemic planner.

CourseRoad allows users to add classes to a vertical timeline, and receive
immediate visual feedback on their progress on requirements for their majors or
minors.

Anyone's who's been an undergraduate knows just how difficult developing a 
four-year plan can be; and with college rankings driven by the percentage of 
four-year graduates, students and colleges alike feel immense pressures to keep 
track of every last requirement.

CourseRoad makes that possible. Since its launch two years ago, CourseRoad has 
grown virally at MIT, and has now reached 50% undergraduate adoption--all 
through student use of the site.
